Terra is a modern world generation modding platform, primarily for Minecraft. Terra allows complete customization of
world generation with an advanced API, tightly integrated with a powerful configuration system:

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`package` World Generation API

        A voxel world generation API with emphasis on end user configuration and extensibility.

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`versions` Platform Implementations

        Several platform implementations available to users. Platform implementations act as the layer between the API and the platform it's running on.

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`plug` Addon System

        An addon loader, which allows addons to interface with the Terra API in a platform-agnostic setting.
        Addons provide the majority of Terra's world generation *functionality*.

    .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`file-code` Core Addons

        Several *core addons*, which implement the standard configurations of Terra. Core addons can be thought of as the config 'standard library'.
