These instructions are intended for setting up a Terra world for Fabric singleplayer.

Procedure
---------
1. From the Minecraft main menu, navigate to the world creation screen via Singleplayer -> Create New World.

2. Select More World Options....

3. Cycle through the World Type: ... button until you see World Type: Terra:<CONFIG_ID>. To use the default pack select Terra:OVERWORLD.

4. Configure any other world settings you wish to change.

5. Press Create New World and check if your new world is using Terra world generation.

If you followed the steps correctly without any errors, then you have successfully set up your client with Terra!


Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during the world set up process, be sure to check you have followed each step correctly.
Check for any errors in your client logs and try to interpret what the issue might be.

If you are unable to set up a world successfully, and have attempted to fix any issues yourself,
