=====================
Bukkit World Creation
=====================

.. note::

    This guide is intended for the **Bukkit** version of Terra.
    
    :doc:`Other Platform Installations <index>` :octicon:`chevron-right`

.. warning::
    We will be replacing the server's default world with a new Terra world.

    Because we are working with changes to worlds **ensure that you have made the necessary backups** before making any destructive changes!
    

We will be replacing the server's default world with a new one that uses Terra as its generator.

If you would like to use a world manager like Multiverse Core to create a world instead of manually setting it as
outlined here, please refer to :doc:`Setting a Generator Through a World Manager<worldmanager-bukkit-world-creation>`

Procedure
---------

#. Ensure your server is not running.

#. If you missed it above, please make a backup of any relevant world folders in your server directory.

    If you're using a fresh server you won't need to worry about this!

#. Configure your server's world to use the new config as a generator:

   #. Navigate to the `bukkit.yml` file which is also contained within your server directory, and open it with any text editor.

   #. Assign your new generator to the default world by **adding the following lines to the end of the file**:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      worlds:
        <LEVEL NAME>:
          generator: Terra:DEFAULT

.. attention:: These lines are **not** present by default, you have to add them yourself!

#. Replace `<LEVEL NAME>` with the server's configured `level-name`. This can be found in the `server.properties` file
   under the 'level-name' key. By default, level-name is set to `world`.

#. Either delete the existing world folder (the name of this folder is covered above) in your server directory, or
   rename it to something else (for example `world_backup`).

#. Boot your server back up.

    Your server should re-generate the world folder during startup.

#. Join your server and check if your new world is using Terra world generation.

If you followed the steps correctly without any errors, then you have successfully set up a server with Terra!

Setting up Another World
------------------------

If you have already done this process before and wish to set up another existing world (such as the Nether or End) with
a new generator, you can simply add the world to the `worlds` key like so:

.. code-block:: yaml
   
   worlds:
     existing_world_name: 
       generator: Terra:EXAMPLE_PACK_1
     <NEW WORLD NAME>: 
       generator: <NEW GENERATOR ID>

Here is an example with two worlds configured:

.. code-block:: yaml

   worlds:
     world: 
       generator: Terra:OVERWORLD
     world_nether: 
       generator: Terra:NETHER

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you run into issues during the world set up process, be sure to check you have followed each step correctly.
Check for any errors in your server console/logs and try to interpret what the issue might be.

If you are unable to set up a world successfully, and have attempted to fix any issues yourself,
please feel free to shoot us a message on our Discord server and provide any relevant information and most importantly the before mentioned logs!
