Terra's platform-agnostic API allows us to seamlessly support many
Minecraft modding platforms. The currently supported platforms include 
`Fabric <https://fabricmc.net>`_, `Forge <https://files.minecraftforge.net/>`_, `Quilt <https://quiltmc.org/>`_, and the `Bukkit <https://dev.bukkit.org>`_
ecosystem. In regards to Bukkit, we officially support `Paper <https://papermc.io>`_\+
implementations only, including but not limited to `Pufferfish <https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish>`_
and `Purpur <https://purpurmc.org/>`_.

        Fabric is the base platform Terra is primarily developed for. Recommended for running Terra in a singleplayer environment, or on a small server
        with friends.

        :link: quilt
        :link-type: doc
        :class-title: sd-text-primary 

        Quilt is recommended for running Terra in a singleplayer environment, or on a small server
        with friends.

        :link: forge
        :link-type: doc
        :class-title: sd-text-primary 

        Forge is recommended for running Terra in a singleplayer environment, or on a small server
        with friends. If you only wish to use Terra without other Forge specific mods, we recommend
        using Fabric instead.

    .. grid-item-card:: Bukkit Server :octicon:`chevron-right`
        :link: bukkit
        :link-type: doc
        :class-title: sd-text-primary 

        Recommended for large servers for lots of people. You'll probably want to use
        Bukkit, simply because of all the plugins available for large servers. We do not
        recommend using Bukkit for small servers, for that, use Fabric.
