Manifest Addons
===============

The Manifest Addon Loader is one of the two default bootstrap addons in Terra. The other is the bootstrap addon
loader itself. Any addon that is not itself a bootstrap addon should not use the bootstrap addon loader, so most
addons will want to use the Manifest Addon Loader, as it is included by default.
