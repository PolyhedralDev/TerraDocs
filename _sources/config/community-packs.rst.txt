Community Packs
===============

As of `30/6/2022`, there currently are no community created config packs that exist for Terra v6,
excluding the default `Overworld`_ pack.

This is expected as Terra v6 has not been released for long, and we have not built up sufficient
documentation to provide developers with the means to develop new packs for it.

If you wish to get more out of Terra, or tweak things to better fit your vision, we would recommend
modifying the `Overworld`_ pack, which provides many preset configurations and variables to play
around with. See the :doc:`/config/development/modifying-existing-pack` guide to get started.
