What is TerraScript?
====================

TerraScript is a custom scripting language with JavaScript-like syntax that is
designed for writing custom :doc:`structures </config/documentation/objects/Structure>`.
It is simple to learn and easy to use, and incredibly powerful at the same time.

You can use TerraScript for anything from creating procedurally generated structures such as
unique variations of trees and rocks to large complex structure layouts such as mineshafts and dungeons.
