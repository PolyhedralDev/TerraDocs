TerraScript documentation has not been migrated from the old Wiki yet.

You can find the old Wiki TerraScript documentation here:

https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/TerraWiki/wiki/TerraScript-Syntax

https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/TerraWiki/wiki/TerraScript-Functions

Some information is outdated or undocumented in the old Wiki,
such as the ``id`` at the start of scripts being removed, (where ``.tesf`` files
are now identified by their file name), or some of the changes made in Terra v6
such as the introduction of new functions. Aside from those things the language
has largely remained the same.
