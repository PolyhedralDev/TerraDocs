ColorSampler
============

:superscript:`*Config object requires the 'library-image' addon to use`

A color sampler is a config defined function that assigns a color for every XZ coordinate pair.
Color samplers are typically used to distribute things across the entire world by utilizing color data,
for example using a heightmap to shape terrain, or an image to draw where biomes should go.

Color samplers differ from :doc:`Image` s in that they can provide colors for any XZ coordinate, whereas
``Image`` s only work with a set size. 


Types
=====

Different types of ``ColorSampler`` provide different behaviours and may have additional parameters for configuring that behavior.

The type is specified by setting the :bdg-primary:`type` parameter to the name of the type. If the same name is used by two different addons, you can prefix the name with ``ADDON_NAME:`` to specify which one to use.

A list of available types for ``ColorSampler`` are listed below:

---------

COLOR
-----

Provides the same color for any input.


:bdg-primary:`color` :doc:`/config/documentation/objects/ColorString`\ - The color to output.

---------

SINGLE_IMAGE
------------

Outputs the pixels of an ``Image``, colors for coordinates outside the bounds of the image
are provided by a 'fallback' color sampler, which typically will be the `COLOR`_ type.


:bdg-primary:`align` Alignment 

:bdg-primary:`image` :doc:`/config/documentation/objects/Image`\ - The image to be sampled

:bdg-primary:`outside-sampler` :doc:`/config/documentation/objects/ColorSampler`\ - The sampler that provides colors for coordinates outside the bounds of the ``Image`` .

---------

TILED_IMAGE
-----------

Outputs a repeating grid of pixels sourced from the provided ``Image`` .


:bdg-primary:`align` Alignment 

:bdg-primary:`image` :doc:`/config/documentation/objects/Image`\ - The image to be sampled

---------

ROTATE
