ColorSampler
============

A color sampler is a config defined function that assigns a color for every XZ coordinate pair.
Color samplers are typically used to distribute things across the entire world by utilizing color data,
for example using a heightmap to shape terrain, or an image to draw where biomes should go.

Color samplers differ from :doc:`Image` s in that they can provide colors for any XZ coordinate, whereas
``Image`` s only work with a set size. 


Types
=====

Different types of ``ColorSampler`` provide different behaviours and may have additional parameters for configuring that behavior.

The type is specified by setting the ``type`` parameter to the name of the type. If the same name is used by two different addons, you can prefix the name with ``ADDON_NAME:`` to specify which one to use.

A list of available types for ``ColorSampler`` are listed below:

---------

COLOR
-----

:superscript:`Added by the 'library-image' addon`

Provides the same color for any input.


`PARAMETERS:`

:bdg-primary:`color` :doc:`ColorString` - The color to output.

---------

SINGLE_IMAGE
------------

:superscript:`Added by the 'library-image' addon`

Outputs the pixels of an ``Image``, colors for coordinates outside the bounds of the image
are provided by a 'fallback' color sampler, which typically will be the `COLOR`_ type.


`PARAMETERS:`

:bdg-primary:`image` :doc:`Image` - The image to be sampled

:bdg-primary:`align` Alignment 

:bdg-primary:`outside-sampler` :doc:`ColorSampler` - The sampler that provides colors for coordinates outside the bounds of the ``Image`` .

---------

TILED_IMAGE
-----------

:superscript:`Added by the 'library-image' addon`

Outputs a repeating grid of pixels sourced from the provided ``Image`` .


`PARAMETERS:`

:bdg-primary:`image` :doc:`Image` - The image to be sampled

:bdg-primary:`align` Alignment 

---------

ROTATE
------

:superscript:`Added by the 'library-image' addon`

`PARAMETERS:`

:bdg-primary:`color-sampler` :doc:`ColorSampler` 

:bdg-primary:`angle` :doc:`Float` 

---------

TRANSLATE
---------

:superscript:`Added by the 'library-image' addon`

`PARAMETERS:`

:bdg-primary:`color-sampler` :doc:`ColorSampler` 

:bdg-primary:`x` :doc:`Integer` 

:bdg-primary:`z` :doc:`Integer`
