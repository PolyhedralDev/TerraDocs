What is Noise?
==============

In procedural generation, noise refers to a set of
randomly\ `* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator>`_ generated values.
These values are produced by various noise algorithms, mathematical functions that provide different patterns of numerical values.

Using noise is one of the primary ways to distribute things in the world, such as where biomes are placed, how terrain is shaped, and where features such
as flora and trees generate.

Just about every random aspect of world generation in Terra is influenced by noise to some degree, so having a basic understanding of it will be useful in configuring and modifying generators.
