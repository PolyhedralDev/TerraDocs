# Terra Docs

Documentation for [Terra](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra/).

Based on [Sponge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeDocs)'s documentation tooling.

## Usage

1. Install tooling
   * `pip` for Sphinx and its dependencies.
   * `npm` for Gulp and its dependencies.
   * [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) for rendering diagrams.
2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -g gulp
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run Gulp:
   ```bash
   gulp 
   ```


Gulp will open a browser window displaying the HTML generated by Sphinx for the reStructuredText documentation.
Changes made to documentation sources will automatically update the browser view.
