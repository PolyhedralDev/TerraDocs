Registries

Registries are a very important concept in Terra. They allow Terra, the platform, and other addons to know
your addon's objects exist, and how to identify those objects.

What is a Registry
==================

A registry can be thought of as a map_ of *Registry Keys* to *Entries*. Registries register a particular type
of object, grouping them together. Registries *uniquely identify* their entries, only one entry can exist per key.
