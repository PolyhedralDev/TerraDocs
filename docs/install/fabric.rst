.. tip::

    If you have already installed Terra or already know how to install Fabric mods, you can skip to the world creation
    guide at the bottom of this page.

Installation
------------

1. Download the latest Terra Fabric release hosted on Modrinth `here <https://modrinth.com/mod/terra>`_.
You can find what version of Terra you should download for your version of Minecraft :doc:`here <versions>`.

.. important::
    
    Make sure you grab the correct version! The Modrinth page contains releases for multiple platforms, so make sure you
    selection the **Fabric** release, **not the Forge** release.

2. Once you have downloaded the ``.jar`` file from Modrinth, simply place the
file into your `mods` folder located inside your Minecraft client or server directory.

3. Restart your server and verify Terra has loaded.
