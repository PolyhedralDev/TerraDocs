    .. note::

        Lots of people get confused about what the difference is between Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper.

        **Bukkit** is an API, a way for developers to interface with and write plugins
        for the Minecraft server.

        **Spigot** is an *implementation* of the Bukkit API, It's a platform that allows the Minecraft
        server to load and run Bukkit plugins. Bukkit itself is no longer maintained by the Bukkit team,
        so now SpigotMC maintains both Bukkit (the API) and Spigot (the implementation).

        **Paper** is a *fork* of Spigot, a project based on Spigot that extends It's functionality. Paper
        adds many performance optimizations to the Minecraft server, and also extends the Bukkit API.

        **What does this have to do with Terra?**

        We refer to the entire Bukkit ecosystem (Bukkit API, Spigot, Paper and friends..) as *Bukkit*
        simply because Bukkit is the name of the API. **However** - Terra develops against and tests on
        Paper. We do this because Bukkit and Spigot simply do not expose the required API for Terra to
        be fully functional. Paper's extended API does. This means that while Terra will still *work*
        on Spigot, there will be (important) features missing.

        **TL;DR - Use Paper, or a fork of Paper.**
