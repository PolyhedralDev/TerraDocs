What is Noise?
==============

In Terra, noise does not refer to sound you can hear, but rather a series of
`randomly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator>`_\ * generated values. These values are produced by
something we will call a **noise function** - which is just a fancy algorithm that converts an input into a randomized
numeric output.

.. code-block:: none

   ┌──────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌───────────────────┐
   │ Input parameters │ →  > Noise Function >  → │ Randomized output │
   └──────────────────┘    └────────────────┘    │   (aka 'noise')   │
                                                 └───────────────────┘

Why is Noise Important?
=======================

Noise is a central concept in Terra, because just about every random aspect of world generation is influenced by noise
to some degree. Having a basic understanding of noise and how to manipulate it will give you insight into how worlds are
randomly generated by Terra, and is an important skill to have if you want to develop your own config packs.

Before learning how to manipulate noise, you should first have an understanding of the underlying concepts outlined
here. Don't worry, we won't throw anything *too complicated* at you for now! Having a firm grasp on noise will bring you
closer to controlling exactly how world generation will behave, which is why having a foundational understanding is
important.

Here is just a short of list of things heavily influenced by noise in Terra:


* The placement of biomes in the world.
* How terrain is shaped.
* How flora and trees are distributed.

Noise Basics
============

Here we will cover some key points is grasping noise in Terra. If you feel like certain concepts are too difficult to
understand, feel free to skim over them for now, and revisit them later.

Demonstration
-------------

Let's begin with a demonstration displaying the most basic process of 'creating' noise. We will use a theoretical
implementation of a noise function called `\ *white noise* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise>`_\ , and generate some
values with it. Explaining how exactly our *white noise* function creates these values is outside the scope of this
guide, however is not essential in understanding the general idea.

    We will perform a couple samples with our function, using numbers 1 - 10 as an input, and record the outputs as both a
    number and a shade from black to white. **Conventionally, the values outputted by a noise function will be within a
    range of -1 to 1.** We can visualize the relationship between the value and shade on a number line as such:

    .. image:: /img/concepts/noise/basic_example-04.png

    We will also round the output to one decimal place for simplicity.
    Typical outputs will produce decimals with **much higher** precision than just one decimal place!


**MODEL**

.. code-block:: none

   ┌────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────┐
   │  Input parameters  │ → > White Noise > → │  Randomized output   │
   ├────────────────────┤   │   Function  │   │ within range [-1, 1] │
   │ Number from 1 - 10 │   └─────────────┘   └──────────────────────┘
   └────────────────────┘

**RESULTS**

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/basic_example-01.png

Simple, right? All our noise function does is convert one value to another. You can think of noise functions like a
little number machine that takes an input and scrambles it around to produce an output.

.. note::
   Input numbers do not have to be whole numbers! This means you can input numbers like ``1.5`` and noise functions will
   work still the same way. We've just used integers here for the sake of demonstration.


Determinism
-----------

One requirement of Terra noise functions is that the output must be
`\ *deterministic* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system>`_\ , meaning given any input, the output must always
be the same. This means we can reliably re-produce any 'random' results we get from noise functions by feeding it the
same input.

Going off the results above, when passing the number ``5`` to our *white noise* function, we will always get the number
``0.4`` back.

Seeds
-----

Sometimes, we want to use the same input, and same noise function, but for multiple random unique outputs. In that case,
we can use a seed in our noise function. Seeds are basically a way of getting a whole new uncorrelated set of random
values from the same inputs + noise function. Unlike the input value, seeds must be a whole number, meaning ``5324`` would
be a valid seed, but ``231.23`` would not.

Expanding on our basic model of noise generation we have:

.. code-block:: none

   ┌──────────────────┐   ┌────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐
   │ Input parameters │ → > Noise Function > → │ Randomized output │
   ├──────────────────┤   └────────────────┘   └───────────────────┘
   │ - Seed           │
   │ - Input value    │
   └──────────────────┘

Here is an example using two different seeds to produce different outputs, using the same inputs and noise function from
the example above.

``Seed = 0``

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/basic_example-01.png

``Seed = 1``

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/basic_example-02.png

One usage of seeds that you might be familiar with is minecraft world seeds. A vanilla minecraft world seed gets
inserted into the many noise functions that govern vanilla world generation, resulting in completely different worlds
per seed (since each noise function will return a completely new set of values for each unique seed). Combined with
`determinism <#determinism>`_\ , we're able to produce new unique randomized worlds by picking a random seed, while also
being able to generate the exact same world* provided we use the same seed.

.. note::
    **Vanilla Bedrock Generation Trivia**

    Some noise functions in vanilla Minecraft generation use the same seed for every world (meaning they don't factor
    in the world seed), which can result in every world generating a certain characteristic the exact same way. One
    notable example - the function that controls bedrock formation uses a static seed for every world, leading every
    vanilla generated world to share the same random configuration of bedrock.


Within Terra world generation, all noise producing functions use a combination of the world seed and a value called
**salt**\ , to determine its own seed. Salt is a number you specify when defining noise configurations, and simply gets
added to the world seed. This allows individual noise configurations to use new sets of output values, while sharing the
same base noise function.

Flavors of Noise
----------------

There are many variants and implementations of noise functions, such as our *white noise* function above. Each has their
own quirks, behaviors, and applications, however in general they all follow the same basic principles outlined here. We
will cover a couple of these variants later down the line.

Here is a small list of notable noise functions that are commonly used in Terra:


* Simplex Noise
* Cellular / Voronoi / Worley Noise
* White Noise
* Value Noise

Multidimensional Noise
----------------------

The phrase 'multidimensional noise' may sound intimidating, but don't worry, it's a fairly simple concept to understand.
Simply put, multidimensional noise involves providing **multiple** input values, rather than just one. In every example
thus far, we have only provided one value for each noise *'sample'* (excluding the seed), meaning we are conceptually
only sampling in one dimension, however we can go further.

The simplest example of multidimensional noise is just adding one extra input to our noise function, for a grand total
of 2 inputs. Conveniently, that gives us 2 dimensions, thus we can easily display a set of 2D samples in a grid. We will
refer to the first input as ``X``\ , and the second as ``Z``.

In a new example, let's use a range of 1 - 3 for both ``X`` and ``Z``\ , giving us a total of 9 samples (3 x 3). We will only
label the ``X`` & ``Z`` axes for the sake of simplicity.

**TWO DIMENSIONAL MODEL**

.. code-block:: none

   ┌──────────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐
   │ Input parameters │ → > White Noise > → │ Randomized output │
   ├──────────────────┤   │   Function  │   ├───────────────────┤
   │ - Seed           │   └─────────────┘   │ Displayed as as a │
   | - Input 1 (X)    |                     │ 2D grid of shades │
   | - Input 2 (Z)    |                     └───────────────────┘
   └──────────────────┘

**RESULTS**

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/basic_example-03.png

As you can see, all we have done is added another dimension to our white noise function, allowing for noise to be
depicted as a 2D grid, rather than a list of values.

Taking this experiment further, let's use a larger sample size of 64 x 64:

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/whitenoise64x64.png

What we have done here is essentially produced a random image using our *white noise* function. By default, we will
assume the above format of visualizing noise in 2D as an image, where each output value represents a grayscale pixel.

**HIGHER DIMENSIONS**

Many noise algorithms support an arbitrary amount of inputs, meaning that we can sample noise in any number of
dimensions. Typically, we will only use up to three dimensions in Terra, where each input corresponds to the position on
each axis ``X``\ , ``Y``\ , and ``Z``.

Segmentation
------------

`Segmentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation>`__ in this context refers to splitting a set of values
into several parts based on the range each value fits in to.

.. note::
    This is not a concept specific to noise, but is something to keep in mind, as it is commonly used in conjunction with
    noise and world generation.


The simplest form of segmentation is **thresholding**\ , which simply involves *separating a set of values into two groups
based on whether they're higher or lower than a number*. An example of thresholding would be outputting a value of ``-1``
for input values less than ``0``\ , and outputting a value of ``1`` for every other input, however the output could be
anything, such as ``true / false`` depending on use.

Applying a threshold to every pixel of an image where ``input = intensity of the pixel``\ , ``output = either a black or
white pixel``\ , and ``threshold = 50%``\ , we get the following result:

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/threshold_example.png

.. note::

   We can represent thresholding mathematically as a `piecewise <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise>`_ function:

   .. code-block::

      f(x) =
      {
        -1   if   x <  threshold
         1   if   x >= threshold
      }

   Most applications of segmentation in Terra are essentially fancy piecewise functions like the one above, written
   programmatically.


Segmentation is a useful concept to understand when combined with noise, as it allows us to split noise functions into
distinct values. We will cover an example of segmented noise and an application of it in the following section.

Applying Noise to World Generation
==================================

You might be wondering: *How does this information translate to generating an entire world?* Before we jump straight
from simple noise generation to generating entire worlds, let's just keep it simple and apply the knowledge we've
covered thus far to a simple application.

Planting Grass
--------------

Let's say we have a patch of land, and we want to generate some tall grass on it, how would we determine where the grass
goes? The first thing we will want to do is define some basic rules for generating grass, before we get to the part
where noise is involved:


* ``Grass`` may only generate on top of ``Grass Blocks``.
* ``Grass`` may only replace ``Air``.

Simple enough, now we know that grass will only generate where appropriate. With only these rules however, we would end
up with grass on top of every single grass block! What if we only wanted it on *some* grass blocks? Well we can use our
*white noise* function for that!

Let's feed our *X & Z world coordinates & seed* into our *2D white noise* function, which will give us a randomized
output value (from -1 to 1 as discussed) for every X-Z column for any given world seed. We will then use that output
value to determine whether we place some grass or not. The way this will be determined is by simply
`thresholding <#segmentation>`__ it! We'll start with a threshold of ``0``\ , where any value below our threshold will mean
``place grass``.

**GRASS PLACEMENT MODEL**

.. code-block:: none

   ┌──────────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────────┐
   │ Input parameters │ → > White Noise > → │ Randomized output │ → >   Threshold Function    │
   ├──────────────────┤   │   Function  │   ├───────────────────┤   ├─────────────────────────┤
   │ - World Seed     │   └─────────────┘   │   A value from    │   │ If below the threshold, │
   | - X Coordinate   │                     │     -1 to 1       │   │ place grass. (Displayed │
   | - Z Coordinate   │                     └───────────────────┘   │   as a green pixel)     │
   └──────────────────┘                                             └─────────────────────────┘

**RESULTS**

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/grass_64x64_50pcthreshold.png

As you can see, we now have a method of randomly determining if grass should be placed or not for any given
`X-Z coordinate <#multidimensional-noise>`_ in `any world <#seeds>`_. We can even reduce / increase how much grass we get by
modifying our threshold value:

``Threshold = -0.25``

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/grass_64x64_25pcthreshold.png

Lowering the threshold from ``0`` to ``-0.25`` results in less grass because we are effectively removing the values between
``-0.25`` and ``0`` from falling below the threshold. Conversely, *increasing* the threshold will result in more grass, as
more values will fall below the threshold.

Combining this with our rules we established earlier, we now have a method of checking for any block whether it should
be grass or not.

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/grass.png

Coherent Noise
==============

Thus far, we have only covered noise that outputs seemingly random tv-static-like values, which is fine for simple
applications like the grass example above. But how can we get noise capable of producing smooth rolling hills, vast
mountains, and other structured random generation? Let's place the white noise function under the category
**'random noise'**\ , and introduce a new category of noise functions called **'coherent noise'**.

**WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?**

The main difference that separates *random noise* from *coherent noise* is that while random noise functions produce
noise with no apparent structure, coherent noise functions produce *'structured'* noise, where adjacent input values
produce correlated output values.

To get a better idea of the difference, here is a visualization of two different 2D sampled noise functions that both
share the same inputs:

``Random | Coherent``

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/whitenoise64x64.png

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/opensimplex2_64x64.png

As you can see, the coherent noise example has a discernible structure where output values are smooth, compared to the
random noise example where there's no apparent structure. The coherent noise function used above is known as
**Simplex noise**\ , and is one of the many flavors of noise provided in Terra.

Segmenting Noise
================

Now that we have introduced coherent noise, we can provide a better visual example of noise
`segmentation <#segmentation>`_. Let's use the following list of colors and distribute them across a noise function
via segmentation:

.. code-block:: yaml

   colors:
     - Red
     - Yellow
     - Green
     - Blue

.. note::
    Since we know that `noise outputs will generally be between -1 and 1 <#demonstration>`_\ , we will need to assign each
    color its own a range *within* the output range ``[-1, 1]``. To do this, it's helpful to visualize things on a number
    line like so:

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/basic_example-05.png

From this we can intuitively see that ``blue`` corresponds to the range ``[-1, 0.5]``\ , ``green`` to ``[-0.5, 0]`` and so on.
Thankfully, you won't ever have to define every range required for segmentation by hand, as Terra will automatically
segment noise for you, but it's still useful to get an idea of what is happening behind the scenes. Let's finally
segment some *simplex noise* by categorizing the output values into our colors based on the range they fit in.

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/posterized_opensimplex2_64x64.png

This is where the usefulness of segmentation comes in - *we can treat these colors as anything*\ , whether that is a set
of biomes, a pattern of blocks, or anything else that requires a list and a noise function. For example, ``red`` could
represent a tropical island biome, ``yellow`` a beach, ``green`` shallow ocean, and ``blue`` deep ocean. Generally lists like
this will be defined as a `weighted pool <./Weighted-Pools>`_ such that you can easily weigh certain items to take up more
space as needed. As an example, here is what our new biome list may look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   biomes:
     - TROPICAL_ISLAND: 1
     - BEACH: 1
     - SHALLOW_OCEAN: 1
     - DEEP_OCEAN: 1

Manipulating Noise
==================

Now that we have covered some essential topics regarding noise, let's talk about creating, configuring, stretching,
squishing, tweaking, and remixing it!

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/splashes/rocky_noise.png

Noise Configs
-------------

So how exactly does this information translate to actually configuring noise in Terra? This is where we will introduce
**noise configs**. When configuring `config packs <./Config-Packs>`_ many options will require a noise config, which is
written in YAML just like most other areas of pack development. The simplest noise config just requires a ``type``\ , which
defines the noise function for use in the context of a noise config definition.

Here what that would look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: <Noise Type>

We can bring back our *white noise* function from earlier, which has type ``WhiteNoise``\ , and insert it into the template
above, giving us the following noise config:

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: WhiteNoise

Noise Config Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to specifying the noise function to use, the ``type`` key will also determine what other keys become available
as either *required* or *optional* when defining a noise config. Some ``type``\ s will have additional keys that need to be
specified to function properly, and others like ``WhiteNoise`` don't require anything extra.

One example of an *optional* key available when specifying the ``WhiteNoise`` type is ``salt``. The function of salt is
covered in `Seeds <#seeds>`_ if you need a refresher. Here is what the above example looks like with the ``salt`` key added:

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: WhiteNoise
   salt: 2321

Another thing to note is that most optional parameters have a pre-defined default value that's set when not specified.
When the ``salt`` key is not included in a noise config, it will default to its predefined value ``0``.

Noise Tool
^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we know how to write a simple noise config, we can use a handy program aptly named the **Noise Tool** to
preview what our config looks like.

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/noise_tool.png

The Noise Tool was specially designed for creating, previewing, and modifying noise configs, and is also what was used
to generate every image of noise used on this page. You can find the Noise Tool on GitHub -
`Source <https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/NoiseTool>`_ / `Download <https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/NoiseTool/releases>`_

.. note::
    We suggest that you follow along the rest of this section with the Noise Tool, so you can try out parameters get the
    hang of writing your own noise configs. Playing around and experimenting on your own is a great way of learning what
    each parameter does, and will give you an intuition on how you can fine tune them to your advantage.


For a complete list of noise function ``type``\ s and their parameters available in Terra, please refer to the
`Noise Configuration <./Noise-Options>`_ documentation.

Frequency
---------

You might be wondering how we control just how large or how small details produced by noise functions are - This is
where the concept of **frequency** comes in. Frequency is a number that modifies the scale of noise, where higher
frequency produces more 'zoomed out' noise, while lower frequency results in more 'zoomed in' noise.

Let's preview some comparisons of the same noise function with varying frequencies:

``2x Frequency | 1x Frequency | 0.5x frequency``

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/opensimplex2_64x64_freq_double.png

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/opensimplex2_64x64.png

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/opensimplex2_64x64_freq_half.png

As a general rule of thumb:

**HIGHER FREQUENCY**

* Zooms *out*.
* Produces *smaller* & *closer* details.
* Increases the density of 'points' per unit of space.

**LOWER FREQUENCY**

* Zooms *in*.
* Produces *larger* & *more spread out* details.
* Decreases the density of 'points' per unit of space.

**IN A NOISE CONFIG**

Frequency can be defined for applicable ``types``\ s via the ``frequency`` key like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: <Noise Type>
   frequency: <Desired Frequency>

Something to note is that tweaking frequency is only really useful for functions in the
`coherent noise <#coherent-noise>`_ category. You're able to modify the frequency of random noise based functions, however
they don't have the property of being able to scale like coherent noise functions do. There isn't much reason to scale
the frequency of a random noise function, as doing so functionally has same effect as changing the seed.


.. note::

    **Under The Hood - How frequency works**

    The math behind frequencies is very simple: *multiply the input coordinates of a noise function by the
    frequency*. Here is a model of the process:

    .. literalinclude:: diagram/frequency.txt

    For example, if we have a frequency of `2`, and want to sample the coordinates `(X = 3, Z = 2)`, first the coordinates
    will be multiplied by the frequency `2`, giving us the scaled coordinates `(X' = 6, Z' = 4)`. This new set of
    coordinates will then be input into the noise function which will then give us the final output value.

        Based on this logic, we can deduct that the input:

        `(X = 3, Z = 2, Frequency = 2)`

        Will give the exact same output when inputting:

        `(X = 6, Z = 4, Frequency = 1)`

    Higher frequencies effectively produce *faster changes* when incrementing input coordinates, which is why higher
    frequencies make details closer and therefore smaller.



In Context
==========

To get a better idea of how noise configs get used in packs, Here is what one looks like in the context of a
`palette configuration <./Palette-Configuration>`_. The noise config is highlighted.

.. literalinclude:: code/noise_palette.yml
    :language: yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 8-10

The usage of noise here controls the arrangement of the `weighted pool <./Weighted-Pools>`_ of materials highlighted in
red. To get a better idea of the relationship, here is a screenshot of a biome which uses the above palette
configuration:

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/palette_example.png

This is also another great example of `noise segmentation <#noise-segmentation>`_ in action with weighted pools. You can
see our ``OpenSimplex2`` function has been segmented equally between grass blocks and dirt, giving us a nice random
pattern of surface blocks in the biome.

Fractal Noise
=============

In some situations, `coherent noise <#coherent-noise>`_ on its own may be far too smooth and uniform to produce
'\ *realistic*\ ' results. Looking at the images above, you may notice plain simplex is quite *blobby*\ , which may not be
desired for applications where more detail is required. This is where **fractal noise** comes in.

The basic premise of fractal noise that we can produce more detail by stacking multiple of the same noise function on
top of each other, where each successive function (called an **octave**\ ) has a higher `frequency <#frequency>`_ and a
scaled down output value (making it contribute less to the overall noise). This process of progressively stacking
incrementally smaller noise layers to produce a `fractal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal>`_ effect is referred to
as `fractal Brownian motion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Brownian_motion>`_ (Commonly abbreviated as fBm).

It might sound quite complicated in writing, so we can demonstrate this concept visually to get a better idea of what's
happening:

``1 Octave (Regular Noise) | 2 Octaves | 3 Octaves | 4 Octaves``

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/fractal/opensimplex2_1_octave.png

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/fractal/opensimplex2_2_octaves.png

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/fractal/opensimplex2_3_octaves.png

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/fractal/opensimplex2_4_octaves.png

As you can see, the more octaves we add, the more detailed the noise gets. This is the main application of fractal
noise - to produce more detail, especially at lower frequencies where detail is sparse. You won't have to worry about
the exact math behind how each octave gets stacked, as Terra will handle all of that for you.

**IN A NOISE CONFIG**

When fractalizing noise configs, we define the fractalizer as *its own noise config*\ , which takes *another noise config*
as an input. The syntax for this is as followed:

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: <Fractalizer Type>
   function:
     type: ... # Noise config to be fractalized

As you can see, we have the main noise config for our fractalizer, and a second noise config *nested* inside under the
``function`` key. The ``function`` key is the only **required** parameter for all fractalizers.

Based on this template, we can create a real noise config. Let's use the ``fBm`` fractalizer, with an input function with
``type`` ``OpenSimplex2``\ :

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: fBm
   function:
     type: OpenSimplex2

Pretty simple, all we've done is passed some *simplex noise* into the *fBm* function. Fractalizers have a couple
additional parameters, including ``octaves``\ , ``lacunarity``\ , and ``gain``. Here is another example config with those
parameters already defined:

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: fBm
   function:
     type: OpenSimplex2
   octaves: 3
   lacunarity: 2
   gain: 0.75

Feel free to preview this config in the `Noise Tool <#noise-tool>`_\ , and have an experiment with each parameter to see
what they all do. To see all available fractalizers and their parameters, please refer to the
`Noise Configuration <./Noise-Options>`_ documentation.

Domain Warping
==============

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/splashes/overwarped.png

Similar to fractal noise, domain warping involves manipulating the input, aka the *domain* , before it's passed to the
noise function. More specifically, the domain of a noise function will be warped via translation by the output of a
secondary warping function.

To demonstrate domain warping more clearly, let's take a 64 x 64 square of samples in a space. Our function *to be
warped* will be a checkerboard pattern, and our *warping function* will be some basic simplex noise.

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/domainwarp/checkerboard.png

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/domainwarp/simplex_warp.png

When domain warping the checker board function by the simplex we get the following result:

.. image:: /img/concepts/noise/domainwarp/checkerboard_warped.png

As you can see, our once perfectly square boxes have been contorted out of shape by the warp function.

**IN A NOISE CONFIG**

To use domain warping, we will need to set the ``type`` to ``DomainWarp``\ , and specify two additional required keys
``function`` and ``warp``. As you may have already guessed, both ``function`` and ``warp`` need to be set to a noise config,
similar to how `fractalizers <#fractal-noise>`_ accept an input function:

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: DomainWarp
   function:
     type: ... # Noise config to be warped
   warp:
     type: ... # Warp noise config

Additionally, we can specify ``amplitude`` which determines how much the function defined in ``function`` will be warped by
the ``warp`` function. Here is an example of a real noise config which warps low frequency simplex with another simplex
function:

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: DomainWarp
   function:
     type: OpenSimplex2
     frequency: 0.005
   warp:
     type: OpenSimplex2
   amplitude: 20

Again it's recommended that you try out this noise config in the `Noise Tool <#noise-tool>`_ and see what changing each
parameter does - What happens if you use ``WhiteNoise`` as a warp function instead?

   To get an in depth understanding of what's happening, let's explain the formula that is used to achieve domain warping:

Chained Functions
=================

Because some keys such as ``function`` and ``warp`` accept a noise config, something we can do is *feed a
`domain warp <#domain-warping>`_ function into another domain warp function*. In fact, we could feed **any** noise
function into any other one, given it has a parameter that accepts a noise config. This is incredibly powerful, as it
allows for constructing complex highly configurable systems of noise. Here is an example where we domain warp some
`fractalized <#fractal-noise>`_ simplex by more fractalized simplex (which has also been domain warped by more...
fractalized simplex!):

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: DomainWarp
   amplitude: 300

   function:
     type: fBm
     function:
       type: OpenSimplex2
       frequency: 0.002

   warp:
     type: DomainWarp
     amplitude: 20

     function:
       type: fBm
       function:
         type: OpenSimplex2
         frequency: 0.003

     warp:
       type: fBm
       function:
         type: OpenSimplex2
         frequency: 0.02

Conclusion
==========

Now that you've got an idea of `what noise is <#what-is-noise>`_\ , `how it works <#noise-basics>`_\ , and a couple ways of
`manipulating it <#manipulating-noise>`_\ , you should now be equipped with the necessary  knowledge to start configuring
your own fancy noise functions for use in your own customized world generation! For more information on the available
noise functions in Terra, please refer to the `Noise Configuration <./Noise-Options>`_ documentation. If you have any
further questions, feel free to ask us in our `Discord <https://discord.gg/PXUEbbF>`_\ !
