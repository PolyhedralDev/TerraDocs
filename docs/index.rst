Welcome to the Terra Docs!
==========================

Terra is a modern world generation modding platform, primarily for Minecraft. Terra allows complete customization of
world generation with an advanced API, tightly integrated with a powerful configuration system.


Terra consists of several parts:
 - A voxel world generation API with emphasis on configuration and extensibility
 - Several platform implementations, the layer between the API and the platform it's running on.
 - An addon loader, which allows addons to interface with the Terra API in a platform-agnostic setting
 - Several "core addons," which implement the "default" configurations of Terra. These addons can be thought of as the config "standard library"
