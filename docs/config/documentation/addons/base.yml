    Expression:
      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        A mathematical expression that may use various mathematical operators, variables / constants, and functions, and returns a floating point number when evaluated.

        Expressions are defined as strings and evaluated by `Paralithic <https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Paralithic>`_. 

        Expressions are written using simple mathematical syntax, for example the expression ``3 + 2 / 8``, which would represent ``3`` plus the division of
        ``2`` by ``8``.

        Number Syntax
        =============

        Numbers are always handled as `floating point <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic>`_ numbers.

        A number by itself is a valid expression.

        - Numbers can be defined simply like ``5832``.

        - Decimals are written as a whole number, a ``.``, then the decimal fraction. For example ``64.34``.

        - Trailing zeroes after the decimal point are permitted: ``64.00``.

        - Underscores can be used to create a visual separator (and are ignored in numbers), for example to separate each hundreds place: ``1_000_000``.

        - A quantifier letter can be added after a number to specify its quanity, for example ``2m`` is equivalent
          to ``2 * 1000`` or ``2000``, where ``m`` refers to the metric prefix 'mega'.

        ========== ============= ===============================================
        Quantifier Value         Name
        n          0.000 000 001 `Nano <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano->`_
        u          0.000 001     `Micro <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro->`_
        m          0.001         `Milli <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milli->`_
        K          1_000         `Kilo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo->`_
        M          1_000_000     `Mega <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega->`_
        G          1_000_000_000 `Giga <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giga->`_
        ========== ============= ===============================================

        - Numbers can be prefixed with a ``+`` or ``-`` to indicate whether they're positive or negative. For example ``-1337`` and ``+1337``.

        - Numbers can use `scientific notation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation>`_, where the character ``e`` (or ``E``)
          separates the significand from the exponent. For example ``6.72e9`` is equivalent to ``6.72 * 10^9`` or ``6_720_000_000``.

        Variables
        =========

        Named constants / variables are numbers that are identified by a name. They can be referenced by simply stating their name, for
        example to reference ``myVariable`` in an expression: ``myVariable * 20``.

        *There is no way to define new variables within an expression*. Variables are made available external from the expression.
        What variables are available will depend on the context of the expression, some config
        objects have certain variables like ``x`` and ``y`` that change based on world position, some allow you to define your own named constants for use
        inside the expression.
        
        Built-in constants
        ------------------

        The following constants are available to use in all expressions:

        - ``pi`` - Approximately ``3.14159``. `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi>`__
        - ``euler`` - Approximately ``2.71828``. `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)>`__

        Operators
        =========

        .. _expression-boolean-representation:

        Boolean Representation
        ----------------------

        Expressions only work with floating point numbers, but they also support various operators that involve
        boolean math. To support such operators, 'false' is represented as the value ``0``, and 'true'
        is represented as *any value that is not* ``0``. If an operator returns 'true' then that means 
        it will return the value ``1``. 

        .. note::

            Boolean values are almost always used with the ``if`` `builtin function <#Builtin Functions>`_, so
            in many cases the numerical boolean representation will be invisible. For example the expression
            ``if(1 > 2, 5, 8)`` has no explicit reference to exact values ``1`` and ``0`` (i.e. true and false).

        Available Operators
        -------------------

        The following is a list of operations available in expressions, grouped from highest precedence to lowest, where higher precedence
        operators are evaluated first. Words ``expr``, ``left``, and ``right`` are used to indicate a subexpression (which could be a
        number, a variable, another operator, etc..):

        ========== ================= ========================================================
        Precedence Syntax            Description

        1          ``(expr)``        Grouping of expr, allows for controlling precedence
        1          ``|expr|``        Absolute value of expr
        \-
        2          ``-expr``         Negate expr / make expr negative
        \-
        3          ``left ^ right``  Exponentiation, left to the power of right
        \-
        4          ``left * right``  Multiply left and right
        4          ``left / right``  Divide left by right
        4          ``left % right``  Left modulo right
        \-
        5          ``left + right``  Add left and right
        5          ``left - right``  Subtract right from left
        \-
        6          ``left < right``  True if left is greater than right, otherwise false
        6          ``left <= right`` True if left is less than or equal right, otherwise false
        6          ``left > right``  True left is greater than right, otherwise false
        6          ``left >= right`` True left is greater than or equal to right, otherwise false
        6          ``left = right``  True left is equal to right, otherwise false
        6          ``left != right`` True left is not not equal to right, otherwise false
        \-
        7          ``left && right`` True if left and right are true, otherwise false
        7          ``left || right`` True if left or right are true, otherwise false
        ========== ================= ========================================================

        Associativity
        -------------

        Binary operators (i.e. operators that take two arguments) are left associative, meaning given
        a sequence of operators with the same precedence like so ``3 - 2 + 1 + 3``, they will be evaluated
        from left to right like so: ``(((3 - 2) + 1) + 3)``.

        Functions
        =========

        Functions are called by writing the function name, proceeded by a pair of parenthesis which
        contain any arguments. Successive arguments are separated by a comma ``,``.

        - No arguments: ``exampleFunction()``
        - One argument: ``exampleFunction(3)``
        - Several arguments: ``exampleFunction(3, 2)``

        Function arguments are expressions, for example:

        - ``exampleFunction(3 + 2 / exampleFunction(9 * 5))``

        Builtin Functions
        =================

        The following is a list of built-in functions available in all expressions:

        ============= ========= =====================================================================================================================================

        ============= ========= =====================================================================================================================================

        White Space
        ===========

        White space characters (spaces, newlines, tabs) are permitted in expressions. Whitespace can be used to separate parts of an expression,
        for example to split it into multiple lines, and or add space between operators to aid readability. Any sequence of white space is equivalent.

        For example splitting a function's arguments into multiple lines::

            atan2(
              1 + 45,
              4 / 8
            )

        .. note:: 

            When defining multi-line expressions in YAML, it is recommended to use the `block style <https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#812-literal-style>`_ syntax
            indicated by the ``|`` character after the ``:`` to indicate the string is mutli-line, for example:
  
            .. code:: yaml
              
                expression: |
                  atan2(
                    1 + 45,
                    4 / 8
                  )

        Comments
        ========

        Any text after and including the sequence ``//`` on the same line is a comment. Comments are ignored.

        For example: ``4 * 2 // This is a comment``

        Multiline comments are also supported, text between the ``/*`` and ``*/`` delimiters is treated as a comment and is ignored.

        For example:

        .. code::

          atan2(
            1 + 45,
            4 / 8
            /* Here is a multi line comment
               all this extra text is ignored */
          )

      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        A list of values each with an assigned weight.

    NoiseSampler:
      type: TEMPLATED
      description: |
        .. seealso::

            :doc:`/config/development/noise/index`

        A sampler is a config defined function that provides a value when given a position and seed.

        A 'sample' is defined as the value produced by a single calculation provided by a sampler. A collective set of
        samples is regarded as 'noise'.

        Noise produced by noise samplers :doc:`determine some kind of behaviour </config/development/noise/use>` for each block or column. This behaviour
        is dependent on the context of the sampler definition. 

    Range:
      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        A range of integer numbers, represented with a minimum and maximum value.
        
        The defined minimum value is inclusive of the represented values while the **maximum is not included**. For example, given a min of ``2`` and a max of ``5``, the range would represent the values ``2, 3, 4``.

      types:
        int:
          description: |
            A range can be defined as an integer representing just a singular number. For example a range defined as ``3`` is equivalent
            to a range with a min of ``3`` and a max of ``3+1`` or ``4``.
            
            When defined under a parameter called ``range`` this would look like:

            .. code:: yaml
              
              range: 3
        map:
          description: |
            To specify the minimum and maximum values, a range can be defined as a map with the following parameters:
          footer: |
            When defined under a parameter called ``range`` this would look like:

            .. code:: yaml
              
              range:
                min: 2
                max: 5
          params:
            min:
              type: Integer
              summary: The minimum value (inclusive) of the range.
            max:
              type: Integer
              summary: The maximum value (exclusive) of the range.

    BiomeProvider:
      type: TEMPLATED
      description: |
        A biome provider provides a :doc:`/config/documentation/objects/Biome` for any given position in the world. Biome providers
        are the main way to determine and configure *where* biomes will generate.

        You can use the aptly named `Biome Tool <https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/BiomeTool>` to preview biome distribution defined by your
        pack's BiomeProvider. It is recommended to run the Biome Tool from your ``Terra`` directory so that all the addons
        and packs you are developing with are loaded by the Biome Tool.

    Biome:
      type: REGISTRY_KEY
      description: |
        Represents a reference to a Terra biome defined by a :doc:`/config/documentation/configs/BIOME` config.
        
        ``Biome``\s are defined as the referenced biome's ID. For example a ``BIOME`` config with an id of ``FOREST`` would be referenced in a ``biome`` parameter like so:

        .. code:: yaml
          
          biome: FOREST

    Palette:
      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        Represents a reference to a :doc:`/config/documentation/configs/PALETTE` config.
        
        ``Palette``\s are defined as the referenced palette's ID. For example a ``PALETTE`` config with
        an id of ``GRASS_MIX`` would be referenced in a ``palette`` parameter like so:

        .. code:: yaml
          
          palette: GRASS_MIX

    Feature:
      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        Represents a reference to a :doc:`/config/documentation/configs/FEATURE` config.
        
        ``Feature``\s are defined as the referenced feature's ID. For example a ``FEATURE`` config with
        an id of ``OAK_TREES`` would be referenced in a ``feature`` parameter like so:

        .. code:: yaml
          
          feature: OAK_TREES

    Structure:
      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        Represents a reference to a structure via its id.

    Block:
      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        Defines a block id. What block ids can be used is dependent on the platform. All block ids in
        the base Terra platforms are Minecraft block ids, for example ``minecraft:grass_block``.

        Block states can additionally be specified by including comma separated pairs with an contained within square brackets
        after the id, for example: ``minecraft:note_block[instrument=harp, note=9]``.

    Distributor:
      type: TEMPLATED
      description: |
        When defined in a :doc:`/config/documentation/configs/FEATURE` config, distributors determine which columns in the world
        structures can be placed in.

        Distributors operate in 2D. For each set of 2D coordinates, a distributor will return either *true* or *false*,
        where true means a structure may generate within that column.

    Locator:
      type: TEMPLATED
      description: |
        When defined in a :doc:`/config/documentation/configs/FEATURE` config, distributors determine what Y levels a structure
        can be placed at.
        
        Locators iterate through each block within a column of blocks in the world (typically within a constrained Y level range
        defined by the specific locator), and return either *true* or *false* if structures should generate at
        that position or not. 

    GenerationStage:
      type: TEMPLATED

    Tag:
      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        Tags are a way of identifying biomes, and are defined as strings. Tags are primarily used for biome distribution to group
        biomes together to be distributed in a certain way. For example, all biomes tagged with ``USE_DESERT_OASIS`` could be configured 
        to randomly be replaced with a desert oasis biome by the :doc:`/config/documentation/objects/BiomeProvider`\.

        All biomes implicitly have the tag ``ALL``. This allows for every biome to be a target by specifying ``ALL``.

        All biomes also are implicitly tagged with their own id, meaning to reference a specific biome via tag, you simply use
        its id.

    PlatformBiome:
      type: MULTI_TYPE
      description: |
        A reference to a platform specific biome defined as a string. For all base Terra platforms, biomes are referenced by Minecraft
        biome ids as you would see them in the f3 debug screen, for example ``minecraft:plains``. This also includes any modded biomes
        that may be available.
